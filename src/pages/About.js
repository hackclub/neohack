              <p>
                You Ship We Ship (YSWS) is a unique program where you build something amazing and we reward you for it! 
                In Neohack, you spend 5 hours building a plugin for Neovim, and in return, we send you a Neovim shirt.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's simple: you ship (build) a Neovim plugin, and we ship (send) you a shirt.

              <h2>The Neovim Community</h2>
              <p>
                Neovim is more than just a text editor - it's a community of developers who love to customize and extend their development environment. 
                With Neohack, we're encouraging this spirit of contribution and innovation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Every plugin you build becomes part of the larger Neovim ecosystem, helping thousands of developers improve their workflow.

              <h2>Why Neovim Plugins?</h2>
              <p>
                Neovim plugins are the lifeblood of the editor. They add functionality, improve workflows, and make coding more enjoyable. 
                By building plugins, you're not just getting a shirt - you're contributing to a tool that thousands of developers use every day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether it's a productivity tool, language support, or a UI improvement, every plugin makes Neovim better for everyone.
